Model Selection:

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) perform well on structured data.
Experiment with ensemble models or stacking to combine the strengths of multiple algorithms.

5.) Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune parameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and learning rates.
